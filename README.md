# AGRISENSE: Smart Agriculture Solution

## 1. Brief Introduction

Uran Sprout is a smart agriculture solution that leverages real-time soil data to guide farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection and cultivation strategies. The system collects data such as pH, temperature, and moisture levels using sensors connected to a NodeMCU. This data is sent to a central server, where an application processes the inputs and provides recommendations on optimal crops, fertilizer usage, and methods to maximize yield. Additionally, the platform offers routine plans for selected crops and real-time suggestions during unexpected scenarios.
